# Glycolysis Summary

- **Location**: Occurs in the cytoplasm of cells.

- **Starting Substance**: Begins with glucose, a six-carbon sugar.

- **Main Function**: Breaks down glucose into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. It's the first step in cellular respiration.

- **Steps**:
  - Glucose is phosphorylated and converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate through a series of steps.
  - Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is split into two three-carbon sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
  - DHAP is converted into G3P, so two molecules of G3P are processed in subsequent steps.
  - G3P undergoes a series of reactions to produce pyruvate, generating ATP and reducing NAD+ to NADH in the process.

- **Energy Production**:
  - Net gain of 2 ATP per glucose molecule (4 ATP produced, but 2 ATP used in the initial steps).
  - Produces 2 NADH molecules, which can be used in the Electron Transport Chain to generate more ATP.

- **Key Enzymes**: Includes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase among others.

- **Significance**:
  - Universal pathway found in all life forms - from yeast to mammals.
  - Does not require oxygen (anaerobic process), allowing energy production under anaerobic conditions.
  - Provides intermediates for other metabolic pathways like amino acid synthesis.
