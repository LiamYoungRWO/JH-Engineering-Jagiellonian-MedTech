1. Glycolysis
   - Location: Cytoplasm
   - Process: Breakdown of glucose into 2 pyruvate molecules
   - Key Products: 2 ATP, 2 NADH

2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)
   - Location: Mitochondria
   - Process: Conversion of Acetyl-CoA into energy-carrying molecules
   - Key Products: NADH, FADH2, GTP (or ATP), CO2

3. Oxidative Phosphorylation and Electron Transport Chain
   - Location: Inner mitochondrial membrane
   - Process: Production of ATP using energy from NADH and FADH2
   - Key Products: ATP, Water (Oxygen as the final electron acceptor)

4. Pentose Phosphate Pathway
   - Location: Cytoplasm
   - Process: Generation of NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis
   - Key Products: NADPH, Ribose-5-phosphate

5. Gluconeogenesis
   - Location: Mainly in the liver
   - Process: Synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources
   - Key Products: Glucose

6. Fatty Acid Metabolism
   - Locations: Synthesis in cytoplasm, Oxidation in mitochondria
   - Process: Synthesis and breakdown of fatty acids
   - Key Products: Acetyl-CoA (from oxidation), Fatty acids (from synthesis)

7. Amino Acid Metabolism
   - Process: Utilization of amino acids for protein synthesis and energy
   - Key Steps: Deamination (removal of nitrogen), Carbon skeletons enter various pathways

8. Urea Cycle
   - Location: Liver
   - Process: Conversion of ammonia into urea
   - Key Product: Urea (for excretion)
