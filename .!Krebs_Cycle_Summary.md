# Krebs Cycle Summary

- **Location**: Takes place in the mitochondria of cells.

- **Starting Substance**: Begins with Acetyl-CoA, which is derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

- **Main Function**: A key part of cellular respiration, responsible for oxidizing Acetyl-CoA to CO2 and generating energy-rich molecules.

- **Steps**:
  - Acetyl-CoA combines with Oxaloacetate to form Citrate.
  - Citrate undergoes a series of transformations, losing two molecules of CO2 in the process.
  - Enzymatic reactions regenerate Oxaloacetate, completing the cycle.

- **Energy Production**:
  - Produces 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 per cycle (per Acetyl-CoA), which are used in the Electron Transport Chain to generate ATP.
  - Directly produces 1 GTP (or ATP), which can be used by the cell for energy.

- **Key Enzymes**: Includes enzymes like citrate synthase, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and others that facilitate the cycle's reactions.

- **Significance**:
  - Central pathway connecting various biochemical processes.
  - Provides precursors for amino acids, fatty acids, and glucose synthesis.
  - Plays a crucial role in aerobic energy production.
